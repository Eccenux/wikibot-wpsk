# WP:SK

Some cleanup scripts for plwiki articles etc.

Don't run scripts unless you have time fix things later.

## Requirements

Scripts use globally installed Pywikibot (PWB). You must install and configure it. 

  - You should have a bot user.
  - Install Python (Tested with Python 3.10).
  - Install PWB with `mwparserfromhell`.
  - Prepare auth in `user-config.py` and `user-password.py`.
  
See: [Pywikibot installation](https://doc.wikimedia.org/pywikibot/stable/installation.html).

Check if pwb is working and get some info:
```
pwb -help
```
